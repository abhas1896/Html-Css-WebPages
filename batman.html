 		After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together and after all the good and bad moments we have been through, I think its time I let you know how I feel about you.

         <p>

     	     You complete my darkness with your light. I love:


     	 </p>   

     	     <ul>
     	
          <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>

          <li>the way you look at Justice</li>


          <li>the way you see good in the worst things</li>


          </ul>

          
          <p>


          have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over time.
